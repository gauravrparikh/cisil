1. Overall Job Access

```{r}
seattle@data$OverallJobAccess <- as.numeric(seattle@data$OverallJobAccess)
```

# Plot the "Normalized measure of overall access to jobs for low wage job seekers"
```{r fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7}
# Use the cartography library to do the choropleth map
# install.packages("cartography")
library(cartography)
choroLayer(spdf = seattle, df = seattle@data, var = "OverallJobAccess")
title("Overall job access")
```
We then standardize Ag so the maximum is 1 and the minimum is 0 and each value within it is
proportional to the position relative to the maximum and minimum.

- The block is Vashon Island to orient this map with google maps (https://www.google.com/maps/@47.421051,-121.6942323,9z)

- Unequal commute map: https://www.urban.org/features/unequal-commute


Jobs are concentrated along the inner city routes as well as in the south east. Large companies concentrate along the line stretching vertically across the inner city.
What is located in the SouthEast?

```{r}
seattle2@data$OverallJobAccess <- as.numeric(seattle2@data$OverallJobAccess)
```

```{r fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7}
# Use the cartography library to do the choropleth map
# install.packages("cartography")
library(cartography)
choroLayer(spdf = seattle2, df = seattle2@data, var = "OverallJobAccess")
title("Overall job access")
```

```{r}
seattle3 = seattle[ seattle@data$OverallJobAccess > 2 | seattle@data$OverallJobAccess < 0, ]
```

```{r fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7}
# Use the cartography library to do the choropleth map
# install.packages("cartography")
library(cartography)

seattle3@data$OverallJobAccess <- as.numeric(seattle3@data$OverallJobAccess)

choroLayer(spdf = seattle3, df = seattle3@data, var = "OverallJobAccess")
title("Overall job access (high values)")
```
The values in the 30s and 40s seem to be water or national parks. 

2. Job Access via Transit

```{r}
seattle@data$Access30Transit <- as.numeric(seattle@data$Access30Transit)

# seattle@data$Access30Transit <- as.numeric(seattle@data$Access30Transit[seattle@data$Access30Transit > 0])

# lines[lines$X > 400 & lines$Y=="YES", ]
```


```{r fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7}
# Access30Transit: Higher values are better.
choroLayer(spdf = seattle, df = seattle@data, var = "Access30Transit")
title("Jobs accessible via transit (within 30 min)")
```
The transit systems in the inner city, the North East, and South East are the most accessible.

```{r}
seattle2 = seattle[ seattle@data$Access30Transit >=0 & seattle@data$Access30Transit <= 1 & seattle@data$OverallJobAccess >= 0 & seattle@data$OverallJobAccess <= 1, ]
```

```{r}
seattle2@data$Access30Transit <- as.numeric(seattle2@data$Access30Transit)
```

```{r fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7}
choroLayer(spdf = seattle2, df = seattle2@data, var = "Access30Transit")
title("Jobs accessible via transit (within 30 min)")
```


3. Count of Low Wage Labor Force

```{r}
seattle@data$lowwagelaborforce <- as.numeric(seattle@data$lowwagelaborforce)
```

```{r fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7}
choroLayer(spdf = seattle, df = seattle@data, var = "lowwagelaborforce")
title("Low Wage Labor force (count)")
```
In Seattle, an influx of relatively high-income earners has led the gentrification of many historically low-income neighborhoods in the central city. Incumbent residents, especially low-income renters, have moved elsewhere in search of affordable housing, increasing typical commute times for low-income workers.

Notice the patch in the North and South of the inner city.

4. Spatial Mismatch (Spatial mismatch: Ratio: # jobs : # low wage job seekers normalized. Higher is worse.)


```{r}
seattle@data$spatialmismatch <- as.numeric(seattle@data$spatialmismatch)
```

```{r fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7}
choroLayer(spdf = seattle, df = seattle@data, var = "spatialmismatch")
title("Spatial Mistmatch: Darker Indicates More Mismatch")
```
The suburbs in the South and North face the worst spatial mismatch!


Composition of geographic blocks by race?


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
