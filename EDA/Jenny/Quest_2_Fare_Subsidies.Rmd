The Gist:

Treatment: Passport
Control: $15
Response: Does it impact their ridership after the experiment ended? Do they continue to load value on their LIFT card? Do they re-enroll in ORCA LIFT?

Individuals who got the passport wouldn’t need to load value during the time the passport was active, and we are interested in knowing whether, for example, have a few months’ passport vs. $15 in value leads people to load value **in the future.**

Higher proportions of Amharic and Chinese found in the control. Proportion of English is higher in the passport group.

# what if the NA values are people who did not qualify?

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(usethis)

use_git_config(user.name = "JennyHuang19",
               user.email = "yjh3@duke.edu")
```


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
